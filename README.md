## ðŸ“œ Abstract
Patients with type 1 diabetes often struggle with glycemic control, leading to long-term health complications. Closed-loop insulin delivery systems, which utilize control algorithms, offer improved regulation of blood glucose levels. This paper compares two common control algorithmsâ€”Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID). Research indicates that MPC outperforms PID in maintaining glucose levels within target ranges, as it incorporates predictive modeling to account for meals, exercise, and insulin sensitivity. The findings highlight the potential for MPC to improve diabetes management and reduce health risks associated with poor glycemic control.

## ðŸ“– Summary
This research explores:
- The role of **closed-loop insulin delivery systems** in diabetes management.
- A comparison between **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** and **Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)** algorithms.
- The effectiveness of MPC in predicting and stabilizing blood glucose levels.
- Future research opportunities for improving control algorithms in artificial pancreas systems.
